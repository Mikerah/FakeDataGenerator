# FakeDataGenerator

## Overview
FakeDataGenerator is a Django web app that let's users create fake datasets for their data science/machine learning projects. Lately, I've been trying to learn machine learning and implement basic 1D versions of popular algorithms. However, I couldn't find anything online that just gave me a simple txt file or csv file. So, I decided to create FakeDataGenerator.

## What I've learned
I haven't learned a lot during this project but it has increased my understanding on what I can and cannot do with the Django framework. I learned how to easily incoporate downloads into a django web app (in less than 5 lines of code). I have also learned how to deal with csv files. Also, I honestly didn't think I would be able to finish such a project in so little time. It is nice to see how my skills with the Django web framework have developped over the past year and I hope to improve over the next years.

## Improvements
As always, there is a ton that can be done to improve this project. A major thing that needs to be improved it the formatting of the text file when a user downloads a dataset. When I run the standalone generate function, the text file has the perfect formatting. However, this is not the case when one downloads a file straight from the website. And as with my other projects, both my code design and web design skills need to be improved.
